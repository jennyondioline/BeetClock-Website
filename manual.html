          <h2>Using the App</h2>
          <h3>Track a job in progress</h3>
          <p>When you begin work on a job, open BeetClock. On the main screen, select the crop you are working with and the job you are doing in the dropdown menus. Then enter and the number of workers involved in the text field if it is more than just yourself. You can also indicate one or more pieces of equipment (i.e. tractors, tractor implements) being used.   Select each piece of equipment you are using, and tap the + button to add whatever equipment you wish. When everything is set, tap the Start Timer button. A new button will appear that says something like “Harvest: Harvest Beans (started 01:27:PM): Press to Stop”. When the job is finished, just tap this button and the record of your job will be saved to the app. In the mean time you can start new tasks and even close and re-open BeetClock. This will not interrupt the task in progress.</p>
          <a name="q2" id="q2"></a>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <h3>Record a job that was already completed</h3>
          <p>In the BeetClock menu, select Enter time worked. On this screen, select the crop you worked on and the job you did in the dropdown menus. Then enter the number of hours (decimals are OK), and the number of workers involved in the text fields. You can also add one or more pieces of equipment that were used. Add equipment by selecting it on the dropdown menu and tapping the + button. Finally, if the job was not done today, select the date when the job was done by tapping Select a New Date, using the spinners to pick the month, day and year, and tapping Select Date.</p>
          <a name="q3" id="q3"></a>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <h3>Track equipment used in a job</h3>
          <p>You can indicate that you are using one or more pieces of equipment in a job. This will help you keep track of the equipment hours invested in each crop – another important component of the crop budget. To add equipment in the Timer screen or Enter time worked screen, select a piece of equipment from the dropdown menu and press the [+] button. The text above will indicate the equipment that you have assigned to the job. To remove a piece of equipment, select it on the dropdown menu and press the [-] button.</p>
          <a name="q4" id="q4"></a>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <h3>View records of completed jobs</h3>
          <p>In the BeetClock menu, tap View records. You can view all work ever recorded, or you can view work since a particular date. For example, to view work done on tomatoes since June 1st 2016, tap the Select a New Date button, pick June 01 2016 in the spinners, and tap Select Date. Then select Tomatoes in the dropdown menu and tap View Crop Summary. This will list the total labor hours that went into tomatoes since June 1st, and the number of hours that went into each job (note that if two workers trellised tomatoes for three hours each, this is recorded as six hours). To view all jobs done since June 1st on all crops, just tap the View All Records button.</p>

          <br/>
          <br/>
          <h3>Add or delete crops, jobs and equipment</h3>
          <p>To add or delete a crop, tap Manage crops in the BeetClock menu. If you want to add a crop, enter the new crop name in the text field and tap Add Crop. If you want to delete a crop, select the crop name on the dropdown menu and tap Delete Crop. To add or delete jobs or equipment, the steps are basically the same. When you add a new job in the Manage jobs screen, you will need to select a category for the job (either Soil Prep, Cultivation, or Post-Harvest). In the Manage equipment screen you can add or delete equipment by hand, or import equipment from a NOFA Enterprise Analysis Workbook stored on your Google Drive. To import, tap Get Equipment from NOFA Workbook. You will be prompted to select your Google account, and you will then be able to select the name of the workbook that you want. When you tap Get Equipment, the current list of equipment in BeetClock will be replaced by the names from your NOFA workbook. Note that this will not change the equipment names in previously saved records.</p>

          <br/>
          <br/>
          <h3>Correct a mistake</h3>
          <p>We all make mistakes, but in BeetClock they are easy to fix. If you made a mistake while entering a job, just tap Manage records in the BeetClock menu, then tap Delete Individual Records. You will get a list of all the jobs you have previously saved to BeetClock, from the most recent to the earliest. Tap the job you want to delete, and it will be removed from the database. If you have an ongoing job in the timer that is in error, you will need to stop the job before you can delete it.</p>

          <br/>
          <br/>
          <h3>Move data from BeetClock to my personal farm budget</h3>
          <p>There are two main ways to integrate data collected by BeetClock with your personal farm budget. The most flexible way to do it is simply to send a report via email to whatever recipient you like. The report will include a spreadsheet file with summaries of total time worked by crop, and by job within each crop. The report will also contain a spreadsheet with every individual job recorded in BeetClock. You can copy and paste data out of these spreadsheets into any recordkeeping system that you use. To send a report by email, tap Email report in the BeetClock menu. Select a start date for your report by tapping Start Date and select the date on the date spinner. The report will summarize all records since this date. Then enter your name in email address in the text fields, and tap Send Report. The email will take a few seconds to go through, and you will see a notice saying “Report sent successfully!” when it is sent.</p>

          <br/>
          <h3>Move my BeetClock records onto a new phone</h3>
          <p>BeetClock allows you to export all your work records from one phone and import them into another. Go to the Manage Records screen and select Export all records to file. This will create a file in the Downloads folder of your phone with a name like “BeetClockRecords160403033329.csv”. If you have multiple export files, the most recent one will have the highest number in its name. Transfer your export file to the Downloads folder of your new phone and install BeetClock on the new phone. Then select the file name on the Manage Records screen, enter the word “import” in the text box, and tap Import Records. This will import your old records into the new copy of BeetClock. Keep in mind this will also erase any existing records saved in the new copy of BeetClock.</p>
